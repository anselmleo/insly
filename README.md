## Insly Tasks 

I have provided an easy task solution index (index.php).
The solutions can be simulated by cloning this repository and running index.php on a php enabled server.


## Task One:

_**Please see solution in taskone.php file.**_ 

Here, I had to extract the bytes of data, I had to store the binaries as string, store each byte as an element of an array and convert each one to human readable data through a foreach loop.

## Task Two:

- Created a landing page to hold the car insurance calculator form.
- Setup a backend validation to respond with an error message, a status of fail and an error code of 400 more like mimicking an api response type for the frontend to process.
- Created Calculator class to handle insurance policy implementation.
- Created a Helper class to handle csrf check on form and to ensure form was submitted via the submit button.


## Task Three:

- For this task I created a database named "insly" and tables "employees", "employee_info", "info_type" and "employee_languages".
- Setup appropriate relationships
- Inserted sample data
- Created a sample query to view all employee information
